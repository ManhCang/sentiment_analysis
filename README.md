# Sentiment Analysis Project
# Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDb dataset. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. You can download the dataset from Kaggle.

## Setup and Installation
- Clone the Repository
```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
```

- Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3 and pip installed. Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
Copy code
pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
Download NLTK Data
```

The scripts will download the necessary NLTK data files (stopwords and wordnet) automatically. If you need to do it manually, run:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```
- Running the Scripts
### Data Preprocessing
This script preprocesses the raw IMDb dataset by cleaning the text and removing stop words.

```bash
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
```
### Feature Extraction
This script converts the preprocessed text data into TF-IDF features and saves them.
```bash
python scripts/feature_extraction.py
```

### Model Training
This script trains a Naive Bayes classifier on the extracted features and saves the trained model.

```bash
python scripts/model_training.py
```

### Model Evaluation
This script evaluates the trained model on a test set and outputs performance metrics.

```bash
python scripts/model_evaluation.py
```

## Results
The model evaluation script will print the accuracy, classification report, and display a confusion matrix of the trained model's performance on the test data.
